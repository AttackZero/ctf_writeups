Hey everyone! I took some time to look at this yearâ€™s LabREynth CTF. It is hosted by Palo Alto Networks, and this is my first year doing it.

I would like to document my progress as much as time allows. I am usually very busy with work and other things, so I do not know how many challenges I will complete. With that said, I am going to try to learn as much as I can.

LabREynth is broken into a number of tracks: docs, binary, programming, threat, and mobile. Docs are puzzles where you are given a document and have to discover what it is hiding. Binary challenges involve reverse engineering a binary (or set of binaries) to uncover their secrets. Programming challenges are puzzles that are solved by writing programs to solve a problem (like how to get through a maze). Threat is log analysis, and mobile is looking at Android / iOS challenges.

My plan is to jump around and get exposure to as much as I can.
